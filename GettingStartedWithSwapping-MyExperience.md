## Introduction

When I began using swapping technology, I was overwhelmed with the technology. There appeared to be 10 new technologies of which a hundred different settings. The spectrum was wide.

The purpose of this article is to share my experience and assist others who may be new to this technology. By providing a baseline of information, hopefully, you too can produce amazing results in short time.

As a disclaimer, my knowledge is limited to NVIDIA GPU's and CUDA technology.

Before we begin, I would like to note that I am using an older video card. GTX 1080TI. It is not necessary to have the latest and best video card but it is important to know that there are limitations, especially with VRAM. Here is a link to [my sysinfo](./supplements/mysysinfo.md).

## My Default Settings

Swapping encompasses 5 main features of note:
[See Swapping101.md](./Swapping101.md) for detailed explanations.

### 1. üîç Detection

**RetinaFace**
It has a moderate angle tolerance, high clarity tolerance in regards to blur and occlusions. Its speed is moderate with high accuracy.
[See FaceDetectionOverview.md](./FaceDetectionOverview.md) for other options and in-depth explanations.

### 2. üß† Recognition

**InSwapper128ArcFace**
A lightweight model primarily focused on face-swapping, optimized for performance with a resolution of 128x128.

**Strength**:

* Solid choice for standard face-swapping tasks.
* Strong identity preservation thanks to the ArcFace embedding.

**Weakness for Extreme Close-ups**:

* May struggle with extreme close-ups, revealing texture issues and edge artifacts, especially around delicate features like eyes and hairlines.

**Best Use Case**:

* Works well for most regular face-swapping tasks at a reasonable distance.

[See FaceRecognitionOverview.md](./FaceRecognitionOverview.md) for other options and in-depth explanations.

### 3. üß¨ Parsing / Restoration

I use two:

**GFPGAN-v1.4**

* Alignment: Reference
* Fidelity Weight: \~0.3-0.5
* Blend: 30-50% (default)

**RestoreFormer++**

* Alignment: Blend
* Fidelity Weight: \~0.9
* Blend: \~40-80% (depending upon distance to subject)

[See FaceParsersOverview.md](./FaceParsersOverview.md) for other options and in-depth explanations.

### 4. üé≠ Composition & Swapping Logic

This can be a little tricky here because there are so many variables. In my default settings, I only concern myself with two settings:

* **Face Color Correction**: DFL\_Original
* **DFL\_XSeg\_Mask**: Enabled (default value of 0)

### 5. üß≠ Temporal Consistency & Tracking (Essential for Video)

I have nothing to add here yet.

## Summary

In summary, these settings may not be ideal for every scenario, but they‚Äôve served me well as a dependable starting point for general face-swapping‚Äîespecially with subjects at a normal distance, with mild occlusions, and moderate motion. As your use case becomes more specific‚Äîsuch as dealing with extreme close-ups, unusual lighting, or complex motion‚Äîyou may need to experiment and adjust.

Remember: balance fidelity settings with your available VRAM and the visual importance of your target subject. Over-tuning can introduce artifacts or slow down processing without meaningful gains. Start simple, iterate carefully, and test often.

I hope you find this helpful. The journey can be complex at first, but the results are absolutely worth it.
