# Face Detection Overview

Face detection is a critical first step in facial recognition tasks, as it identifies and locates human faces within an image or video frame. This process enables subsequent actions like recognition, parsing, and swapping.

This overview explains the fundamental concepts behind face detection settings, helping to tailor the detection process to specific needs and scenarios.



Face detection is the foundational step in most face-swapping pipelines. It identifies the spatial regions of faces within each frame or image and produces bounding boxes to isolate them for subsequent tasks such as alignment, parsing, and swapping.

## üîç How Detection Works

Face detectors analyze images frame-by-frame to locate human faces. The output typically includes:

- **Bounding box coordinates**
- **Facial landmarks** (optional)
- **Confidence scores** (a.k.a. detection scores)

The accuracy and performance of detection vary by model, lighting, occlusion, pose, and video resolution.

| Parameter                   | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `face_detector`            | Specifies which model to use (e.g., RetinaFace, YOLOv5-face, BlazeFace)     |
| `min_face_size`            | Ignores faces below this pixel threshold                                    |
| `max_faces`                | Limits how many faces to detect per frame                                   |
| `detection_score_threshold`| Filters out detections with low confidence (typically between 0.5 and 0.95) |

## üéØ What Is a Detection Score?

A **detection score** (or confidence score) reflects the model‚Äôs certainty that a given region contains a face, typically ranging from `0.0` to `1.0`.

| Score Range | Meaning                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| 0.90‚Äì1.00   | High confidence ‚Äî almost always a face |
| 0.70‚Äì0.89   | Medium confidence ‚Äî often a face, but verify |
| < 0.70      | Low confidence ‚Äî could be noise or misdetection |

Setting an appropriate score threshold helps strike a balance between missing real faces and including false positives.

## üîß When to Tune Detection Settings

| Use Case                             | Suggested Settings                                                   |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Close-up videos with 1 subject       | `max_faces = 1`, `threshold = 0.90`, use RetinaFace                  |
| Group shots with dynamic scenes      | `max_faces = 5+`, `threshold = 0.70‚Äì0.80`, use YOLOv5-face or RetinaFace |
| Low-end hardware or real-time needs  | `min_face_size = 64`, use BlazeFace, lower threshold to ~0.6         |

## Detect Score

The **Detect Score** is a threshold value used to filter detected faces based on their confidence level. The score represents the probability that a detected feature is indeed a face. A higher detect score means the detection system is more confident about the presence of a face, while a lower score allows more faces to be detected, even with less certainty.

Adjusting the detect score impacts the number of faces identified and their accuracy. Setting the score too low may result in false positives, while setting it too high could miss faces that are present but harder to detect.

---

## Max Number of Faces to Detect

This setting determines the maximum number of faces that the detection model will attempt to find in an image or video. If more faces exist than the set limit, only the specified number will be processed.

---

## üß† Additional Notes

- Accurate detection is crucial: misaligned or missed faces at this stage cannot be recovered downstream.
- Detectors may struggle under:
  - Poor lighting
  - Fast motion blur
  - Extreme occlusion
- Visual inspection (e.g., bounding box overlays) can help assess reliability before batch processing.
