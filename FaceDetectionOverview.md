|--------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **RetinaFace** | ★★★★☆         | ★★★☆☆            | Close to Medium        | ★★★★★           | ★★☆☆☆               | High-accuracy close-to-mid shots       |
| **YOLOv8**    | ★★★☆☆         | ★★★☆☆            | Wide Range             | ★★★★☆           | ★★★★★               | Real-time, multi-face tracking         |
| **SCRFD**     | ★★★★☆         | ★★★★☆            | Medium to Far          | ★★★★☆           | ★★★★☆               | Balanced accuracy & speed, varied angles |
| **YuNet**     | ★★☆☆☆         | ★★☆☆☆            | Close Range            | ★★☆☆☆           | ★★★★☆               | Lightweight tasks, basic webcam input  |

## ✅ Model-Specific Strategies

### **RetinaFace**
- Strong at **fine feature detection**.
- Performs well on **well-lit**, **medium-close range**, and **standard pose** faces.
- Sensitive to **blur** and **extreme tilt**.
- Best when quality matters more than speed.

**Use when:** You need detailed landmarks or are working with consistent lighting and angles.

### **YOLOv8**
- General-purpose detector, great for **real-time detection**.
- Good **angle tolerance**, handles slight blur.
- Fastest among all; suited for **live capture**, **multi-subject scenes**.

**Use when:** You need fast detection in dynamic, multi-face environments with acceptable trade-off in precision.

### **SCRFD**
- Designed for **high performance in tough scenarios**.
- Strong with **blur**, **low light**, and **angled** faces.
- Balanced between RetinaFace and YOLOv8 in **accuracy vs speed**.

**Use when:** You need a robust, dependable face detector for variable input (e.g., vlogs, action shots).

### **YuNet**
- Lightweight and simple.
- Limited range, angle, and clarity handling.
- Useful for **fast detection in constrained environments**, like webcams or embedded systems.

**Use when:** Speed matters and you control the environment (frontal, clear faces).

## 🧠 Practical Recommendations

| Scenario                         | Recommended Model |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Close-up studio shot             | RetinaFace        |
| Real-time detection (e.g. livestreams) | YOLOv8        |
| Motion footage or varying angles | SCRFD             |
| Lightweight systems/webcams      | YuNet             |
